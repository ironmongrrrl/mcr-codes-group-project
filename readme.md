Welcome to the holding bay for Manchester Codes Sept 2020 Cohort final project ideas! 

## // TO ADD AN IDEA ##
1. Hit up Lucy Ironmonger on Slack and request to be a collaborator.

2. Open up terminal, and go: **git clone git@github.com:ironmongrrrl/mcr-codes-group-project.git**

3. Add to the readme, in format below. If you need to add any images etc, add a folder with the title of the project.

4. Push it up using **git push origin main**, adding a commit message with your full name in.

5. If you get any issues pushing up (e.g. a merge conflict), try:

- **git pull** (you may need to check the readme and 'Accept both changes')

- then try **git merge --continue --no-edit** (this completes the process of merging latest changes from the remote repository to your local branch along with the merge conflict fix you've just applied.)

**Project name:** GameFace<br> 
**Project idea:** The concept of this would be to use the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com) which tracks your mileage as you run/swim/cycle. What Strava doesn't do well is encourage competitiveness, which is where this app would come in. <br>A user would be able to challenge another user to either:<br>
- A distance challenge - eg first past the post, to achieve that distance
- A time challenge - how far can you run in a given time period?
- Not an MVP feature but it would be amazing if you could also bet money on who would win and winner takes all eg using the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) but I think it might break some gambling laws, I will look into it...failing that, some sort of points system a la Strava 'King of the Hill' kinda concept. ~Lucy<br>
