Welcome to the holding bay for Manchester Codes Sept 2020 Cohort final project ideas! 

## // TO ADD AN IDEA ##
1. Hit up Lucy Ironmonger on Slack and request to be a collaborator.

2. Open up terminal, and go: **git clone git@github.com:ironmongrrrl/mcr-codes-group-project.git**

3. Add to the readme, in format below. If you need to add any images etc, add a folder with the title of the project.

4. Push it up using **git push origin main**, adding a commit message with your full name in.

5. If you get any issues pushing up (e.g. a merge conflict), try:

- **git pull** (you may need to check the readme and 'Accept both changes')

- then try **git merge --continue --no-edit** (this completes the process of merging latest changes from the remote repository to your local branch along with the merge conflict fix you've just applied.)
